Abi, is a 22-year-old Communication Design student who already started journaling using a paper journal. She built the habit of writing a short journal entry nearly every day. Although she enjoys this method as a way to reflect on her life, she is not quite satisfied with using the paper journal itself.
She is also interested in exploring new technologies.

## "Sudden Change"

Jim, 40, recently got fired from his job of 20 years. It was abrupt without reason. He cannot stop thinking about it. He is an average tech user who writes in the apple notes app and watches football highlights on youtube. He texts his wife on iMessage and uses group me to connect with his friends.

## "Overwhelmed"

Emily, 34, works as a lawyer for a large firm, so she’s accustomed to high-stress work environments. She’s married and has a two year old son named Jack. She was recently promoted, and at first, she was very excited about it. However, her new boss’s expectations are even higher than her old one’s, and they’re often unreasonable. She has been feeling overwhelmed at work, and is usually exhausted by the time she gets home.

# Scenarios

## Abi’s Scenario

Abi usually writes her journal entries when she has some spare time (e.g. waiting for an appointment, on her commute). Taking her paper journal with her all the time feels really cumbersome. She is looking for a simpler alternative which she has always on hand.
She also likes to explore her previous entries and wants to get a better overview of them.

## Jim’s scenario

It’s been a long day of sitting on the couch thinking about getting fired. Jim said that there's so much going on that he finds it hard to remember. He started going to therapy every week and finds it difficult to summarize his week. He desires a way to keep track of what he's going through. 

He’s using good days to keep track of what’s going on with him so he can share it with his therapist.

## Emily’s Scenario

Emily’s had a busy week, and it’s only Wednesday; she’s had to juggle her boss’s latest unexpected demands, not to mention helping take care of her son. She’d like to do something with a friend or two to unwind, and she doesn’t want to wait until the weekend, but she feels too exhausted to organize anything now.

She’s using GoodDays to get a better understanding of her patterns and habits. She hopes to use that information to better structure her reduced free time. She also uses the app as a way to privately vent about her boss.
