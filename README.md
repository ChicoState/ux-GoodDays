# GoodDays

<!-- !!!Brief introduction to the project and the problem it is intended to solve!!! -->

GoodDays enables users to keep a digital journal of their recent activities. By desinging a desktop journaling app we try to aid our users in reflecting on their days and personal habits.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Our research on the GoodDays journaling app highlighted the demand for free, minimalist journaling software.

- Competitive Analysis identified a market gap for a **minimal** desktop application tailored to journaling.
- Heuristic Evaluation of a custom [Notion](https://www.notion.so/gres/10b16469034880e590e9e7024b08de15?v=9569263f9390427290fbf03037c3dc3f) board revealed the following insights:
  - üü© **Visibility of moods**: A colored overview of recorded moods throughout the days would be extremely beneficial.
  - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Easy **selection of actions**: Loggable actions should be easy to identify and customizable during the journaling process.
  - üõü User **guidance on journal creation**: Integrating tips on the journaling process can be critical for newcomers.
- [Personas and Scenarios](personas/) highlight the **diverse** user group interested in journaling.
- Our initial [sketches](sketches/) focus on **mood visualization** and the journal entry creation process.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

- We started by making our [initial wireframes](wireframes/)
- We used a **cognitive walkthrough** to gather in-depth feedback from other UI/UX students
  - Our wireframes **felt incomplete**. We had focused too much on the main screen, and not enough on the other screens
  - However, users **really liked the main screen**, giving us a good idea of how to proceed
- The software engineering team also gathered **informal feedback** on their prototype
- We then **refined our wireframes** with the feedback in mind, and made them **interactive**
- Ultimately, we gave the software engineering team a much clearer idea of what to implement and how
